🎯 **Project Overview**

This project simulates three classic probability scenarios:

- **Monty Hall Problem** - Should you switch doors to win?
- **Dice Sum Probabilities** - Why is 7 the most common dice roll?
- **Poker Hand Odds** - What are your chances of getting a flush?

Each simulation:
- ✅ Runs thousands of trials
- ✅ Compares results with theoretical probabilities
- ✅ Generates visualizations
## ✨ Features

### 1. Monty Hall Problem Simulation
- **Concept**: Tests the counterintuitive probability behind door-switching
- **Key Insight**: Switching doors wins ~66% of the time vs 33% when sticking
- **Code File**: `simulations/monty_hall.py`
- **Output Example**:
  ```text
  Sticking wins: 33.2%
  Switching wins: 66.8%
  ```

  ### 2. Dice SUm Probability Analyzer
  - **Concept**: Calculates likehood of sums when rolling two 6 sided dice
  - **Key Insight**: 7 is the most probable sum(16.67%)
  - **Code File**: `simulations/dice_probability.py`
  - **Output Example**:
    ```text
    Sum 2: 2.81%
    Sum 7: 16.64%
    Sum 12: 2.77% 
    ```

### 3. Poker Hand Odds Calculator
- **Concept**: Simulates probability of poker hands in a 5-card draw
- **Key Insight**:
    - Pair: ~42% chance
    - Flush: ~0.2% chance

- **Code File**: `simulations/poker_odds.py`
- **Output Example:**
    ```text
    High Card: 50.14%
    Pair: 42.38%
    Flush: 0.21%
    ```

## 📊 Results & Interpretation

### 1. Monty Hall Problem
| Strategy  | Theoretical Win % | Simulated Win % |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Stick** | 33.3%            | ~33.5%          |
| **Switch**| 66.6%            | ~66.5%          |

**Conclusion**: Switching doors doubles your chances of winning!

### 2. Dice Sum Probabilities  
**Most likely sums** when rolling two dice:  
- **7** (16.67%) ← *Most probable*  
- **6 & 8** (~13.9% each)  
- **5 & 9** (~11.1% each)  
- **4 & 10** (~8.3% each)  
- **3 & 11** (~5.6% each)  
- **2 & 12** (2.78% each)
