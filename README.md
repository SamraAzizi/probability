ðŸŽ¯ **Project Overview**

This project simulates three classic probability scenarios:

- **Monty Hall Problem** - Should you switch doors to win?
- **Dice Sum Probabilities** - Why is 7 the most common dice roll?
- **Poker Hand Odds** - What are your chances of getting a flush?

Each simulation:
- âœ… Runs thousands of trials
- âœ… Compares results with theoretical probabilities
- âœ… Generates visualizations
## âœ¨ Features

### 1. Monty Hall Problem Simulation
- **Concept**: Tests the counterintuitive probability behind door-switching
- **Key Insight**: Switching doors wins ~66% of the time vs 33% when sticking
- **Code File**: `simulations/monty_hall.py`
- **Output Example**:
  ```text
  Sticking wins: 33.2%
  Switching wins: 66.8%
  ```

  ### 2. Dice SUm Probability Analyzer
  - **Concept**: Calculates likehood of sums when rolling two 6 sided dice
  - **Key Insight**: 7 is the most probable sum(16.67%)
  - **Code File**: `simulations/dice_probability.py`
  - **Output Example**:
    ```text
    Sum 2: 2.81%
    Sum 7: 16.64%
    Sum 12: 2.77% 
    ```
